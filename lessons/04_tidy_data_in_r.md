# Tidy Data in R

In this lesson we will cover the basics of data in R and will do so from a somewhat opinionated viewpoint of "Tidy Data".  There are other paradigms and other ways to work with data in R, but focusing on Tidy Data concepts and tools (a.k.a., The Tidyverse) gets people to a productive place the quickest.  For more on the data analysis using the Tidyverse, the best resource I know of is [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz).  The approaches we will cover are very much inspired by this book.

## Data in R: The data frame

Simply put, a data structure is a way for programming languages to handle storing information.  Like most languages, R has several structures (vectors, matrix, lists, etc.) but since R is built for data analysis the data frame, a spreadsheet like structure with rows and columns, is the most widely used and useful to learn first.  In addition, the data frame (or is it data.frame) is the basis for many modern R pacakges (e.g. the tidyverse) and getting used to it will allow you to quickly build your R skills.

*Note:* It is useful to know more about the different data structures such as vectors, lists, and factors (a weird one that is for catergorical data).  But that is beyond what we have time for.  You can look at what I think is the best source on this information, Hadley Wickham's [Data Structures Chapter in Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html).

## Reading in data

The best way to learn what a data frame is is to look at one.  We can build one from scratch with the `data.frame()` function and while completely creating a data frame from scratch is useful (especially when you start writing your own functions), more often than not data is stored in an external file that you need to read into R.  These may be delimited text files, spreadsheets, relational databases, SAS files ...  You get the idea.  Instead of treating this subject exhaustively, we will focus just on a single file type, `.csv` that is very commonly encountered and (usually) easy to create from other file types.  For this, we will use the Tidyverse way to do this and use  `read_csv()` from the `readr` pacakge.

The `read_csv()` is a re-imagined version of the base R fucntion, `read.csv()`.  This command assumes a header row with column names and that the delimiter is a comma. The expected no data value is NA and by default, strings are NOT converted to factors.  This is a big benefit to using `read_csv()` as opposed to `read.csv()`.  Additionally, `read_csv()` has some performance enhancements that make it preferrable when working with larger data sets.  In my limited experience it is about 45% faster than the base R options.  For instance a ~200 MB file with hundreds of columns and a couple hundred thousand rows took ~14 seconds to read in with `read_csv()` and about 24 seconds with `read.csv()`.  As a comparison at 45 seconds Excel had only opened 25% of the file!

Source files for `read_csv()` can either be on a local hard drive or, and this is pretty cool, on the web. We will be using the former for our examples and exercises. If you had a file available from a URL it would be accessed like `mydf <- read.csv("https://example.com/my_cool_file.csv")`. This is what is shown in our the `narrabay_analysis.R` script on lines 31-42, albeit with some additional magic.  As an aside, paths and the use of forward vs back slash is important. R is looking for forward slashes ("/"), or unix-like paths. You can use these in place of the back slash and be fine. You can use a back slash but it needs to be a double back slash ("\"). This is becuase the single backslash in an escape character that is used to indicate things like newlines or tabs. 

For today's workshop we will focus on grabbing data from a local file, and we already have an example of this in our `narrabay_analysis.R`.  In that file look for the (uncommented) code labeled "read_csv".

For your convenience, it looks like:
